User
it does work now but I still have a problem when I open a vterm buffer it doesnt appear in the perspective buffer list even more all the buffer between ** don't appear any perspective list exepct the none one

The behavior you're observing is likely due to the buffer filtering mechanism in persp-mode. By default, certain buffers (usually transient, internal, or uninteresting buffers) are excluded from perspective buffer lists. These buffers are often denoted by names wrapped in asterisks (*...*), like *Messages*, *scratch*, etc.

The variable that controls this filtering in persp-mode is persp-add-buffer-on-find-file, which is t by default. When it's set to t, only buffers associated with files are added to the current perspective when they're created.

There are a few steps you can take to ensure vterm buffers (or other buffers) appear in the perspective buffer list:

    Modify Buffer Adding Behavior: Set persp-add-buffer-on-find-file to nil to add all buffers to the current perspective when they're created. However, this will also include many uninteresting buffers.

    emacs

(setq persp-add-buffer-on-find-file nil)

Explicitly Add vterm Buffers to Perspective: After creating a vterm buffer (or any other buffer), you can explicitly add it to the current perspective using:

emacs

(persp-add-buffer (current-buffer))

You can automate this for vterm by adding a hook:

emacs

(add-hook 'vterm-mode-hook (lambda () (persp-add-buffer (current-buffer))))

Modify Buffer Filtering: persp-mode uses the function persp-buffer-filter-functions to decide which buffers to exclude from perspective lists. You can modify this list to change the filtering behavior. For example, to prevent vterm buffers from being filtered:

emacs

    (defun my-persp-include-vterm-buffers (buffer)
      (not (with-current-buffer buffer (derived-mode-p 'vterm-mode))))

    (add-to-list 'persp-buffer-filter-functions #'my-persp-include-vterm-buffers)

    This function will return nil for vterm buffers, meaning they won't be excluded by the filter.

Choose the method that best fits your needs. If you want all vterm buffers (and other *...* buffers) to always be part of the perspective buffer lists, then the third option might be the most suitable. If you only want to add certain vterm buffers occasionally, the second option might be better.
